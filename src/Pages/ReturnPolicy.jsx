            We always put our sincerest endeavors into printing and producing
            packaging products, but sometimes, even the most articulated actions
            don’t meet expectations. If you are not fully over the moon, shake
            it off; we are here to help. Any return or refund is easy with us.

          What to Look Before ‘Return’?

            <li>
              Once a customer receives the shipment with any defect, damage, or
              objection, please carefully inspect our packaging products and
              instantly inform us with photographs of the ‘subject objections’
              within 3 business days.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you receive an order with missing items, call and email us
              instantly, along with a packing list of the products.
            </li>
            <li>
              Our official turnaround time is 12 to 15 business days, but it can
              rarely be extended to a few days more due to some high-end color
              matching, time-consuming screen printing, delicate foil printing,
              etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is our practice to ship extra packaging products than the
              actual ordered quantities to all our clients, but please be
              notified that there is always a 5% to 10% increase or decrease
              margin in the packaging items, i.e., boxes, Mylar bags, labels,
              stickers, business cards, and any other printed products. So, if
              rarely, you receive a few items less than the ordered quantities
              then no packaging products, returns, or refunds will be approved
              by us.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you find a notable difference in the dimensions of our
              packaging products above the usable level, then return them.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you make any packaging product from scratch with us, then no
              return or refund will be accepted, as while availing of full
              customization, you partner with us for every packaging procedure.
              So, we don't process any replacement or reimbursement for such
              orders.

              We will smoothly return any of our packaging products if we use a

              final design approval.
            </li>

              Products are returnable if there is any defect in the printing,

              Returns and refunds become acceptable if we (Print 247) have
              printed and produced packaging products that are dissimilar to the
              final approved digital proof, computer-generated 3D mockup or

              Any type of food grade, cosmetics, chemical-related, hazardous, or
              pharmaceutical regulatory-compliant packaging or labeling is the
              client's responsibility. For instance, you will inform us
              beforehand of your packaging requirements according to FDA, FTC,
              USDA, GHS, USDA, or any other industry-specific packaging and
              labeling requirements, as we only print and produce what you
              acquire from us.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case of any discrepancies, please don’t use, open, modify,
              alter, or temper any of the packaging products.
            </li>

              If you ask for a return due to any wrong product delivery or
              shipping error, i.e., damage during transit, misplaced delivery by
              the carriers, shipment delay due to any hidden or unexpected fee,
              any unanticipated regulations, compliance issues (FDA, USDA,
              etc.), disruptions in supply chains by the carriers; in these
              cases, we will bear 70% of the total return shipping costs, and

              We will not be able to return packaging products due to slight
              variations in dimensions or colors caused by digital or monitors’
              calibration [screen colors gamuts, brightness, viewing angles due
              to basic difference between RGB colors of digital screens and
              machine colors, i.e., CMYK, Screen colors, glittering foil colors,
              and physical appearance of the packaging products] (to refrain
              from this issue, we highly recommend getting a physical prototype
